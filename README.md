In this study, we develop a machine learning model to categorise breast masses as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Using a variety of methods, we preprocess the dataset, choose pertinent features, and train the model. The objective is to develop a precise model that supports breast cancer diagnosis and contributes to better medical decision-making.
